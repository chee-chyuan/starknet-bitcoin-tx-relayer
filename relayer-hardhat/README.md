# Deploy And Run The Relayer
<i>Current commands are written only for devnet. It is possible to change to other networks too with some tweaking</i>

Right now, we will need to manually copy to ciaro contracts from `contracts` folder and we will utilize starknet-hardhat 's build functionality to generate artifacts for us.

<i>Remember to run `npm i`</i>

<u>Deploy TxRelay to Devnet:</u><br>
```npx hardhat run ./scripts/deploy_tx_relayer.ts --network devnet```

It will print the address of the TxRelayer of which we will need to update in `.env`

<u>Run the relayer </u><br>
```npx hardhat run ./scripts/relay_block.ts --network devnet```

For now, we will read the files from the `data` folder generated by `block-crawler`. Be sure to run that too.
